<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>Can I apply as an individual?</h2>
<p>No. We’re looking for people to apply on teams. However, if you don’t already have a team you can head over to our <a href="PATH">Facebook Marketplace</a> to find other individuals who might be interested in working with you.</p> 
<h2>If my team is accepted into the <a href="/programme">Prototype phase</a>, do we have to cover the cost of travel to Amman?</h2>
<p>No. The Refugee Learning Accelerator will cover the cost of travel for all successful teams. However, it is your responsibility to make sure that you have a valid passport. </p>
<h2>In the <a href="/programme">Incubate phase</a>, what terms are attched to the funding?</h2>

<h2>I’m Lebanese/Jordanian/Syrian/Iraqi/Palestinian, but live in X, can I still apply?</h2>
<p>Definitely! However, in the application we will ask about your future plans and commitment to the region. We’re looking to support projects that will be based in the Middle East, not another refugee project based in Cambridge, Massachusetts (not that there is anything wrong with this town!).</p>
<h2>What’s the ultimate aim of the Refugee Learning Accelerator?</h2>
<p>This is a pilot phase and--to a certain extent--an experiment. We believe that the Middle East is facing a series of crisis around refugees, youth employment, and education, but that it already has many of the tools necessary to respond to these crises. We’re passionate about supporting young people to… </p>
