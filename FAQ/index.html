																  <h2>Upon completion of the program, will I receive a degree from MIT?</h2>
																  <p class="QA"> No. This is not an accredited education program. </p>
																  <h2>Will participants travel to MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts?</h2>
																  <p class="QA">No. Successful participants will be brought together in Beirut or Amman. There will be no travel to the U.S.</p>
														
<h2>Can I apply as an individual?</h2>
<p class="QA">No. We’re looking for people to apply on teams. However, if you don’t already have a team you can head over to our <a class="class2" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/147496302487491/">Facebook Marketplace</a> to find other individuals interested in forming a team.</p> 
<h2>If my team is accepted into the <a class="class2" href="/program">Prototype phase</a>, do we have to cover the cost of travel to Amman?</h2>
<p class="QA">No. The Refugee Learning Accelerator will cover the cost of travel for all successful teams. However, it is your responsibility to make sure that you have a valid passport. </p>
<h2>In the <a class="class2" href="/program">Incubate phase</a>, what terms are attched to the funding?</h2>
<p class="QA">We do not take equity and programs can exit the accelerator with no further commitments to MIT or the Refugee Learning Accelerator. </p>
					    <h2> What is the time commitment?</h2> 
					    <p class="QA">The time commitment will vary by phase: in the Ideate phase we expect you to spend about 15-20 hours per week working on projects for the Refugee Learning Accelerator; in the Prototype phase teams will spend a week together in Amman, working full-time.</p>
<h2>Does our idea have to be for-profit?</h2>
<p class="QA">No, definitely not! It’s hard to make money off of education, and even harder to do it ethically. While it would be great if teams came up with financially self-sustaining ideas, we recognize that this might not be realistic. We’re committed to providing you with the initial funding and then, as the project develops, helping you find other sources of funding--this could come from investors, but it could also be from governments or philanthropic foundations.  </p>
					    <h2>Does my team all have to be located in one place?</h2>
					    <p class="QA">No. It will probably be easier to work together if at least a portion of your team is co-located, but it is not a requirement. </p>
<h2>Do you provide office space?</h2>
<p class="QA">No. However, in the Incubate stage teams are welcome to use a portion of their funding to secure office space. </p>
<h2>I already have an idea about using technology to support refugee learners, can I still apply?</h2>
<p class="QA">Certainly, but you’ll still have to go through the <a class="class2" href="/program">Ideate stage</a>. We have expertise with what works and what has already been done, when it comes to technology and refugee learners, and we want you to acquire that knowledge as well. </p>
<h2>I’m Lebanese/Jordanian/Syrian/Iraqi/Palestinian, but live in X, can I still apply?</h2>
<p class="QA">Definitely! However, in the application we will ask about your future plans and commitment to the region. We’re looking to support projects that will be based in the Middle East, not another refugee project based in Cambridge, Massachusetts (not that there is anything wrong with this town!).</p>
<h2>What’s the ultimate aim of the Refugee Learning Accelerator?</h2>
<p class="QA">This is a pilot phase and--to a certain extent--an experiment. We believe that the Middle East is facing a series of crisis around refugees, youth employment, and education, but that it already has many of the tools necessary to respond to these crises. We’re passionate about supporting young computer scientists and engineers to think critically about the future of learning.  </p>
